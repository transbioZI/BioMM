Description: The identification of reproducible biological patterns from 
	high-dimensional omics data is a key factor in understanding the biology 
	of complex disease or traits. Incorporating prior biological knowledge 
	into machine learning is an important step in advancing such research. 
	We have proposed a biologically informed multi-stage machine learing 
	framework termed BioMM specifically for phenotype prediction based on 
	omics-scale data where we can evaluate different machine learning models 
	with prior biological meta information.
